## 1. Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)

**Problem Statement**: Reduce the dimensionality of customer data while preserving local relationships for targeted marketing.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: LLE is a dimensionality reduction technique that maintains local structures in high-dimensional data. It is useful for visualizing and understanding data in lower dimensions while preserving the relationships between data points.

## 2. Naive Bayes

**Problem Statement**: Categorize customer reviews into positive or negative sentiments to understand customer satisfaction.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions. It is effective for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis, by predicting the class of text data based on its features.

## 3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Problem Statement**: Reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data to understand key factors influencing customer purchasing behavior.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: PCA is a technique for dimensionality reduction that transforms data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining as much variance as possible. It helps in identifying the most significant factors influencing the data and simplifying analysis.

## 4. Random Forest Classifier

**Problem Statement**: Predict whether a person is likely to purchase a product based on features like age, gender, and estimated salary.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges their results to improve classification accuracy. It is effective for handling various types of data and predicting outcomes based on complex feature interactions.

## 5. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

**Problem Statement**: Identify the most relevant features for predicting employee performance.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: RFE is a feature selection technique that recursively removes the least important features and builds models with the remaining features. It helps in identifying the most influential features for model performance and reducing overfitting.

## 6. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**Problem Statement**: Predict customer churn based on historical data.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: SVM is a classification method that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes in the data. It is used for binary classification tasks and is effective in high-dimensional spaces.

## 7. t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)

**Problem Statement**: Visualize high-dimensional customer purchasing data in a 2D space.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction technique that visualizes high-dimensional data by preserving the local similarities in a lower-dimensional space. It is useful for exploring and understanding complex data structures.

---

## 8. Agglomerative Clustering

**Problem Statement**: Identify distinct customer segments based on demographic information for targeted marketing campaigns.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: Agglomerative Clustering is a hierarchical clustering method that iteratively merges clusters based on similarity. It helps in identifying distinct groups within the data for segmentation and analysis.

---

## 9. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

**Problem Statement**: Categorize customers into distinct segments based on purchasing behavior.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: GMM is a probabilistic model that assumes the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. It is used for clustering and density estimation, providing a flexible approach to segmenting data.

---

## 10. Isomap

**Problem Statement**: Identify patterns and clusters within high-dimensional customer data for marketing strategy optimization.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: Isomap is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that maintains global geometric structure by preserving distances between data points. It is useful for visualizing and analyzing complex data relationships.

---

## 11. K-Means Clustering

**Problem Statement**: Group customers into distinct clusters based on their purchasing behavior.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: K-Means Clustering is an iterative algorithm that partitions data into K distinct clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster. It is widely used for clustering tasks and customer segmentation.

---

## 12. Gradient Boosting Regressor

**Problem Statement**: Predict a continuous target variable based on various input features.

**Libraries Used**:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`

**Description**: Gradient Boosting Regressor is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple weak learners (e.g., decision trees) and combines them to create a strong predictive model. It is effective for regression tasks with complex relationships.
